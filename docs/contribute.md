## Decap CMS Open Authoring Workflow
Decap CMS Open Authoring is a workflow that lets people contribute to a version-controlled document without needing to write code or even clone the repository. Contributors only need a GitHub account. When a user makes a change, the CMS automatically creates a new branch and submits a pull request (PR) with their edits. This is a great way to enable non-technical users to contribute to your content.

### How to Contribute using Decap CMS Open Authoring Workflow
1. Find the CMS URL
The first step is to locate the Decap CMS administration panel. The URL is typically the main website's URL followed by /admin/. For example, if the website is https://example.com, the CMS is likely at https://example.com/admin/.

2. Sign in with GitHub
When you navigate to the /admin/ URL, you'll be prompted to sign in. Since the open authoring workflow is configured with GitHub, select the Login with GitHub option. This will redirect you to GitHub to authorize the Decap CMS application.

3. Create or Edit Content
After logging in, you'll be taken to the Decap CMS dashboard. From here, you can:
    - Create a new entry: Click the New button for the collection you want to add content to (e.g., a new blog post).
    - Edit an existing entry: Select an existing entry from the list to modify it.
    - Use the user-friendly editor to make your changes, which might include adding text, uploading images, or updating metadata.

4. Save and Publish
When you've finished your edits, look for the Save or Publish button, usually in the top right corner. Clicking this will prompt the CMS to create a new branch in the GitHub repository and commit your changes to it. Since open authoring is enabled, it won't merge your changes directly. Instead, it will create a pull request.

5. Review the Pull Request
You'll receive a link to the new pull request on GitHub. A pull request is where the repository maintainers can review your changes before merging them into the main branch. They can comment on the changes, suggest revisions, or approve and merge the PR. This entire process is handled by Decap CMS and GitHub, so you don't need to manually interact with Git commands.
